@"
In QuickPulse, a `Signal<T>` is more than just a way to push values into a flow;
it's a **stateful conduit**. Each `Signal<T>` instance wraps a specific `Flow<T>` and carries its own **internal state**,
including any `Gather(...)` values or scoped manipulations applied along the way.

When you call `Signal.Pulse(...)`, you're not broadcasting into some shared pipeline,
you're feeding **a single stateful flow machine**,
which responds, remembers, and evolves with each input.

This means:

* You can create **multiple signals** from the same flow definition, each with **independent state**.
* Or, reuse one signal to process a sequence of values, with state accumulating over time.

In short: **one signal, one evolving state**.

```
[ Signal<T> ] ---> [ Flow<T> + internal state ]
       |                    ^
       |                    |
       +---- Pulse(x) ------+
```

This design lets you model streaming behavior, accumulate context, or isolate runs simply by managing signals explicitly.
