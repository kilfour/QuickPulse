# Effect

**`Pulse.Effect(...)`** Executes a side-effect without yielding a value.

**Example:**
```csharp
from anInt in Pulse.Start<int>()
from box in Pulse.Gather(1)
from eff in Pulse.Effect(() => box.Value++) // <=
select anInt;
```
**Warning:** `Effect` performs side-effects.
It is eager, observable, and runs even if you ignore the result.
Use when you mean it.
  

**`Pulse.EffectIf(...)`** Same as above, but conditional. 

**Example:**
```csharp
from anInt in Pulse.Start<int>()
from seen42 in Pulse.Gather(false)
from eff in Pulse.EffectIf(anInt == 42, () => seen42.Value = true) // <=
select anInt;
```
